# Speed-Hangman

Speed-Hangman is the classic game of hangman, but with a twist! The objective of the game is to try to guess a word within the allotted time. You'll be given 30 seconds to guess. 
If you can successfully guess the word, you win the round. If you can't make a guess before the time runs out, you lose the game. If you make 6 wrong guesses on the same word, 
completing the hanging body, you lose the round.

## Getting Started
After reading the instructions, just press the start button and immediately start playing.
### Prerequisites
No prerequisites needed. The animals are common animals, so shouldn't be too tough to guess.
